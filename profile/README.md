# Sorbonne University Bolide Contributors

Welcome to the GitHub home of the talented students from Sorbonne University dedicated to autonomous racing with our RC cars!💨 🚗💨

## 🎓 About Us:
We are an organization of students, including both Master 2 and Master 1 students from Sorbonne University, focused on competing in the autonomous RC car races organized by ENS.

## 🏎 Our Mission:
Every year, we form two distinct teams – one led by Master 2 students and the other by Master 1 students – to push the boundaries of autonomous driving technology applied to Sorbonne University's RC cars. Our goal is not just to compete but to learn, and contribute to the future of autonomous racing.

## 🛠️ What We Do:
- Collaborate on cutting-edge autonomous driving projects for Sorbonne University's RC cars.
- Develop and optimize algorithms tailored for real-world RC car racing scenarios.
- Embrace challenges and turn them into opportunities for growth.
- Foster a collaborative and knowledge-sharing community focused on autonomous RC car technology.
